# ðŸš€ Documentation Site Model

## Welcome
Welcome to the **YOUR PROJECT** documentation.
This site is organized to help you easily document the project and its components.

The main section is [System Context](/systemctx/), which will contain the core of your documentation.

The approach is based on the C4 model (<https://c4model.com/>) and proposes 4 main nested views:
 1. System Context: An overview of the actors interacting with the high-level systems of the solution.
 2. Containers: A zoom into the various components of the system context.
 3. Components: For each container, a zoom into its different constituents.
 4. Code: For each component, the code and runtime parameters associated with the components.
