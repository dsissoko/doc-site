# Container Overview

This document provides an overview of the containers that make up **Context1**.  
A container represents an independently deployable software unit within the system, such as web applications, APIs, databases, or message brokers.

## **Purpose**
The purpose of this **Container Overview** is to:
- Define the key containers in this context.
- Explain their roles and interactions within the system.
- Provide a high-level architectural view before diving into individual container details.

## **Containers in Context1**
The following containers are included in this context:

- **Container 3**: [Brief description of its function]
- **Container 4**: [Brief description of its function]
- **... (Add more containers as needed)**

Each container may have multiple **components** inside it, which will be detailed separately in their respective sections.

## **High-Level Diagram**
_(Include a Mermaid.js or other diagram here to visually represent the containers and their interactions.)_
